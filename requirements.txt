**Explanation of changes:**

* **Removed Local Paths:** All lines starting with `file:///` or referencing local build directories have been removed. These are not portable and cause deployment failures.
* **Removed Unnecessary Dependencies:** The original list had over 100 packages, many of which are dependencies of other packages (e.g., `attrs`, `cffi`, `numpy`, `urllib3`). `pip` will automatically install these when it installs the packages listed above.
* **Added Version Ranges:** By specifying version ranges (e.g., `streamlit>=1.49`), you prevent potential dependency conflicts and ensure your app is using a compatible version.
* **Included Core Packages:** I've explicitly included `langchain`, `langchain-core`, and `langchain-community`, as they are essential for your application's logic.
